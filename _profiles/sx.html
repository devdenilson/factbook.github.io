<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<div class=category_data>The islands, with large bird and seal populations, lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration since 1908 - except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia, was a 19th and early 20th century whaling station. Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died in 1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today, the station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. Recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended the exclusive fishing zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island.</div>

<h3>Natural hazards:</h3>
<div class=category_data>the South Sandwich Islands have prevailing weather conditions that generally make them difficult to approach by ship; they are also subject to active volcanism</div>
<h3>Environment - current issues:</h3>
<div class=category_data>reindeer - introduced to the islands on several occasions in the 20th century - devastated the native flora and bird species; some reindeer were translocated to the Falkland Islands in 2001, the rest were exterminated (2013-14)</div>
<h3>Geography - note:</h3>
<div class=category_data>the north coast of South Georgia has several large bays, which provide good anchorage</div>

<h3>Population:</h3>
<div class=category_data>no indigenous inhabitants</div>
<div><span class=category>note: </span><span class=category_data>the small military garrison on South Georgia withdrew in March 2001, replaced by a permanent group of scientists of the British Antarctic Survey, which also has a biological station on Bird Island; the South Sandwich Islands are uninhabited</span></div>

<div><span class=category>etymology: </span><span class=category_data>South Georgia was named "the Isle of Georgia" in 1775 by Captain James COOK in honor of British King GEORGE III; the explorer also discovered the Sandwich Islands Group that year, which he named "Sandwich Land" after John MONTAGU, the Earl of Sandwich and First Lord of the Admiralty; the word "South" was later added to distinguish these islands from the other Sandwich Islands, now known as the Hawaiian Islands</span></div>
<h3>Dependency status:</h3>

<h2>Economy</h2>
<h3>Economy - overview:</h3>
<div class=category_data>Some fishing takes place in adjacent waters. Harvesting finfish and krill are potential sources of income. The islands receive income from postage stamps produced in the UK, the sale of fishing licenses, and harbor and landing fees from tourist vessels. Tourism from specialized cruise ships is increasing rapidly.</div>

<h2>Transnational Issues</h2>
