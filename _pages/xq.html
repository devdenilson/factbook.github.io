<h2 sectiontitle='Introduction' ccode='xq'>Introduction ::  <span class='region'>ARCTIC OCEAN </span></h2>
<div id='field' class='category'>Background:</div>
<div class=category_data>The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US and Canada) and Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two important seasonal waterways. In recent years the polar ice pack has receded in the summer allowing for increased navigation and raising the possibility of future sovereignty and shipping disputes among countries bordering the Arctic Ocean.</div>

<div id='field' class='category'>Location:</div>
<div class=category_data>body of water between Europe, Asia, and North America, mostly north of the Arctic Circle</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Geographic coordinates:</div>
<div class=category_data>90 00 N, 0 00 E</div>

<div class=category_data>Arctic Region</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Area:</div>
<div><span class=category>total: </span><span class=category_data>14.056 million sq km</span></div>
<div><span class=category>note: </span><span class=category_data>includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies</span></div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Area - comparative:</div>
<div class=category_data>slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Coastline:</div>
<div class=category_data>45,389 km</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Climate:</div>
<div class=category_data>polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature range; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Terrain:</div>
<div class=category_data>central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that, on average, is about 3 m thick, although pressure ridges may be three times that thickness; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly straight-line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the icepack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling landmasses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonosov Ridge)</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Elevation extremes:</div>
<div><span class=category>lowest point: </span><span class=category_data>Fram Basin -4,665 m</span></div>
<div><span class=category>highest point: </span><span class=category_data>sea level 0 m</span></div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Natural resources:</div>
<div class=category_data>sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Natural hazards:</div>
<div class=category_data>ice islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually ice locked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing from October to May</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Environment - current issues:</div>
<div class=category_data>endangered marine species include walruses and whales; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage; thinning polar icepack</div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Geography - note:</div>
<div class=category_data>major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia; floating research stations operated by the US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean; snow cover lasts about 10 months</div>

<h2 sectiontitle='Economy' ccode='xq'>Economy ::  <span class='region'>ARCTIC OCEAN </span></h2>
<div id='field' class='category'>Economy - overview:</div>
<div class=category_data>Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.</div>

<h2 sectiontitle='Transportation' ccode='xq'>Transportation ::  <span class='region'>ARCTIC OCEAN </span></h2>
<div id='field' class='category'>Ports and terminals:</div>
<div><span class=category>major seaport(s): </span><span class=category_data>Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US)</span></div>
<div id='field' class='category'>Transportation - note:</div>
<div class=category_data>sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Eurasia) are important seasonal waterways</div>

<h2 sectiontitle='Transnational Issues' ccode='xq'>Transnational Issues ::  <span class='region'>ARCTIC OCEAN </span></h2>
<div id='field' class='category'>Disputes - international:</div>
<div class=category_data>Canada and the United States dispute how to divide the Beaufort Sea and the status of the Northwest Passage but continue to work cooperatively to survey the Arctic continental shelf; Denmark (Greenland) and Norway have made submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental shelf (CLCS) and Russia is collecting additional data to augment its 2001 CLCS submission; record summer melting of sea ice in the Arctic has renewed interest in maritime shipping lanes and sea floor exploration; Norway and Russia signed a comprehensive maritime boundary agreement in 2010</div>
